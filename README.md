Predicting Bitcoin price is extremely complex and should not be done solely based on historical prices. Factors such as market trends, global economic indicators, and company financials should also be considered. This script is a very basic example and should and will be expanded upon for more accurate predictions. Always consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions. It is important to use SimBitAi responsibly and not rely solely on its predictions.
