# SimpleBitcoinPredictionAi
SimBit - Simple Bitcoin Prediction Ai. This Ai Model uses historical Bitcoin price data to predict future prices.
The model is trained on data downloaded from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library, and predictions are made using a linear regression Ai model from `sklearn`.

Predicting Bitcoin price is extremely complex and should not be done solely based on historical prices. Factors such as market trends, global economic indicators, and company financials should also be considered. This script is a very basic example and should and will be expanded upon for more accurate predictions. Always consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions. It is important to use SimBitAi responsibly and not rely solely on its predictions.
